# catchtheletters
A game where you shoot lasers at letters flying through space to capture them, written with p5.js.<br><br>

Made summer of 2020, my first big project with p5. It's mostly functional, although there are still a few issues.<br><br>

<strike>Clicking on a letter multiple times makes it show up in the bank multiple times, when it should be rendered inert after the first successful click.</strike><br>
<strike>The algorithm to determine the initial position and trajectory of a letter is pretty good, but should be altered to prevent any from skimming across the bottom of the screen, where the spaceship console obscures the view.</strike><br>
<strike>Sound doesn't work.</strike> Sound runs only when file is used with a server (if I'm saying that right).<br>
A few elements of the graphic design don't scale to other sizes correctly, especially the "START" label.<br>
On some machines, time passes more slowly, making it easier to get letters.<br>
I also plan to fork this into at least one other version, where players are instructed to spell specific words given a picture clue.
